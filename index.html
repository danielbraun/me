					<h1>Daniel's glorious CV</h1>
					<p>Hello, my name's Daniel and I'm currently a 4th year software engineering student at Shenkar, Israel.</p>
					<p>
						This page was made for the course I'm taking instructed by Mushon Zer-Aviv (@mushon) and Idan Gazit (@idangazit).<br>
						The task was to build a representative page for my professional identity over the internet.
					</p>

					<p>Alongside my grueling courses in Shenkar, as tasking as they may be, I also work for Shenkar's design research institute.<br>
						Here's a list of important stuff:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<a href="https://github.com/danielbraun">Github</a>
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="https://twitter.com/daniel___braun">Twitter</a>
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="http://morning-beach-2325.herokuapp.com">My final project (work in progress)</a>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						And before I completely forgot, I'm a Python/Django developer, so if you're a talented designer I'd love to cooperate to build cool websites.
					</p>
					<p>
						(A cookie is waiting here for you if you can spot this page's design influence.)
